# Unlabeled_image_delete

This code retrieves the names of the txt files in the directory where you save the labeled txt files and creates a list. It also retrieves the names of the jpeg images in the directory where you save the unlabeled images and creates a list. Then it calculates the difference between the two lists and deletes the jpeg image files that are different. If there is a jpeg image file that does not match the name of the labeled txt file, this image file will be deleted.
